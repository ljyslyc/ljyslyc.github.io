## Page Details

### Home

Index page show 5 posts excerpt as a default. Readers can click article title or read more button to see full post. There are recent posts area, categories area and tags area at the right part of the index page. You can also add an area at this part, if you change the file `index.html`.

### Tags

Show posts according to the tags.

### Collections

The user can collect their favorite article links with `markdown` syntax.

### Demo

I use *[Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/)* to rewrite the waterfall responsive layout. Better interactive experience.

### About

The user can write some introduction about theirselves and their site with `markdown` syntax.

### Comments

This theme supports both [disqus](https://disqus.com/) and [多说评论 duoshuo comments](http://duoshuo.com/). It's very easy to config your comments module.

The only thing you need do is to change the `short_name` in the file `_config.yml`. As follows.

```yml
# comments
# two ways to comment, only choose one, and use your own short name
duoshuo_shortname: #xxx
disqus_shortname: xxx
```

### Post Contents

The post contents is fixed at the right side while page is scrolling. There will be a scroll bar on contents while it is outside the window height.

### Code Highlight

While the jekyll is update to 3.x.x, you can use github flavored markdown to write code.

### Light Shadow


You can see the white shadow on the current item in the navbar. I call this light shadow.

### Mobile Adaptation

Of course, I have done a very good mobile adaptation.



### Statistical Analysis

This theme supports Google Analytics and Baidu Statistics， you can just config the id in the file `_config.yml`, as follows.

```yml
# statistic analysis 统计代码
# 百度统计 id，将统计代码替换为自己的百度统计id，即
# hm.src = "//hm.baidu.com/hm.js?xxxxxxxxxxxx";
# xxxxx字符串
baidu_tongji_id: xxxxxxxxxxxx
google_analytics_id: UA-xxxxxxxx # google 分析追踪id
```

## Usage

Welcome everyone to use this theme, this part shows introduction to use.

### 1. Install ruby and jekyll environment

This step and Step 5 mainly talk to you how to launch blog at local. If you don't want to launch at local, you can ignore these 2 steps. But I still strongly suggest to do this. Ensure there is nothing wrong before pushing to the github.

The Windows users can directly use [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/) to install ruby environment. Follow the prompts while installing.

Install jekyll commands:

```
gem install jekyll
```

For more details, you can view the jekyll official website. [https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/)

There may be something wrong at mac OS X El Capitan, you can see the solution at [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#jekyll-amp-mac-os-x-1011]( https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#jekyll-amp-mac-os-x-1011).

If you are interesting in jekyll, you can see the jekyll source code at [https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

duoshuo_shortname: #ljyslyc
disqus_shortname: xxxx
```

When you done, you can also see the comments info at disqus or duoshuo admin console.

#### Statistical analysis info

Get Google Analytics id or Baidu Statistics id：

Visit https://www.google.com/analytics/ or http://tongji.baidu.com/. And follow the prompts at the site.

Of course, if you don't want any statistical and analysis info, you can type nothing at id position.

```yml
# statistic analysis 统计代码

# hm.src = "//hm.baidu.com/hm.js?xxxxxxxxxxxx";
# xxxxx字符串

```

When you done, you can see UV, PV, location etc. info at your own Google Analytics or Baidu Statistic console.

### 4. Write post

You can write posts at folder `_posts`. At the beginning of the post, you should declare layout、title、date、categories、tags、author(optional) info、mathjax(optional，click [here](https://www.mathjax.org/) for more detail about `Mathjax`).

```

```

These follow code is for making contents.
```
* content
{:toc}
```

You can use 4 wraps as a excerpt separator. The words before separator as excerpt show in the index page. When you enter the post page, you can read full article.

The wraps config is in the file `_config.yml`, as follows:

```yml
# excerpt
excerpt_separator: "\n\n\n\n"
```

You should use markdown syntax to write article, just like write readme in github.

You can use 3 \`\`\` to write code block.
